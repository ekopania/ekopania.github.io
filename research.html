<h2>Evolution of the vertebrate retina</h2>

				Vision is critical for foraging, avoiding predators, and finding mates in many species. Despite the importance of vision, visual acuity is highly variable across species, and the relative contributions of different selective pressures and developmental processes to this variation are still unclear. Many vertebrates have specialized high visual acuity regions in the retina, such as an <i>area centralis</i> (region of high retinal ganglion cell density), a horizontal streak (elongated region of high density stretching across the retina), or a fovea (physical indentation in the retina surrounded by a region of high density). Many have proposed hypotheses regarding the ecological drivers that select for these retinal specializations. For example, the fovea is thought to help with vision in complex three-dimensional environments or dim light environments. However, these hypotheses had not been tested using phylogenetic comparisons across multiple species. Additionally, vision is a complex sensory system that requires the successful integration of molecular, cellular, and morphological traits, which may impose constraints on each other. It is unclear how selective pressures on vision act at these different biological scales. I am using phylogenetic comparative approaches to uncover the ecological selective pressures and functional constraints shaping the evolution of retinal specializations in both fish and mammals.

				Murine rodents comprise a rapid radiation of rats and mice from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. They exhibit remarkable diversity in reproductive traits and rapid evolution of genes involved in reproduction. This diversity and rapid evolution is thought to reflect variation in the intensity of sexual selection among species, but other forces such as developmental constraints may play an important role in patterns of reproductive evolution across species. I combine comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and phylogenetic comparative approaches across species spanning the murine radiation to understand the relationships among sexual selection pressures, phenotypic evolution, and the molecular evolution of reproduction in murine rodents.

<h2>House mouse spermatogenesis and speciation</h2>

				Genes involved in sperm development (spermatogenesis) tend to evolve rapidly, but some aspects of spermatogenesis are highly conserved and essential for fertility. These contrasting patterns may result from varying intensities of different selection pressures across the developmental process of spermatogenesis. Rapid spermatogenesis evolution may also have important consequences for sex chromosome evolution and male hybrid sterility, an important reproductive barrier between incipient species. During my Ph.D., I investigated the causes and consequences of rapid spermatogenesis evolution. This work is in collaboration with <a href="https://www.larsonlab.space/">Erica Larson</a>.
